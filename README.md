# QIPs
Qurioz Improvement Proposal. QIPs propose and describe changes made to Qurioz Protocol or algorithm.

People wishing to submit QIPs first should propose their idea as an issue and then formalize it using a PR. After discussion it will be published here. Having an QIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Active. For a QIP to become Active requires the mutual consent of the community. An QIP is not finalized until it has been implemented and is in use. Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Qurioz users.
